Step 1: Andrew commits his changes to the documentation branch, switches to the development branch, and pulls down the latest changes from the cloud on this development branch, including the change I merged previously for the friends group feature.
Commit changes on documentation branch
git commit -m "standardized all docstrings in process.py"

Switch to develop branch
git checkout develop

Pull latest changes on develop down
git pull

Step 2: Then, Andrew merges his documentation branch on the develop branch on his local repository, and then pushes his changes up to update the develop branch on the remote repository.
Merge documentation branch to develop
git merge --no-ff documentation

Push changes up to remote repository
git push origin develop

Step 3: After the team reviewed both of your work, they merge the updates from the development branch to the master branch. Now they push the changes to the master branch on the remote repository. These changes are now in production.
Merge develop to master
git merge --no-ff develop

Push changes up to remote repository
git push origin master
